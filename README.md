# ts2-19-dp-maps

design patterns 1 - ts classes and interfaces

- to enable typescript to be executed in the browser - it will automate alot of tooling ti make it easy
- For example, will enable to have a index.ts file inside of index.html

npm install -g parcel-bundler

parcel index.html

https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/googlemaps
Tell ts there is a global variable called google and the different properties and functions it has.
It's global because its added as script tag in index.html...
